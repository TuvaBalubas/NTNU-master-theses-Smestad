\chapter*{Preface}
This master thesis is the final part of my Master in Interaction Design degree at the department of Design at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The project planning, preliminary studies and literature review was conducted during the autumn of 2017. The work presented in this thesis was conducted and written during the spring of 2018 and the workload corresponds to 30 ECTS.

This project was undertaken after I was challenged with building my first chatbot, and was surprised to find that much work is still to be done regarding how we can improve the user experience of conversational interfaces. After having tried, failed, improved, and completed the design process of this chatbot, I was left with a lot of experiences and insights that I wished to investigate further. And having read the recent reviews and overall reception of chatbots, I was concerned whether this could lead to abandonment of chatbots as service. I therefore wanted to use my final year of my masters, to try and prove at least one assumption regarding conversational agents: can personality improve the user experience of chatbots?

I aim with this master thesis to add to the field of human-computer and human-robot interaction by providing evidence to explain how personality impacts the user experience of conversational interfaces, and how personality affects how humans perceive chatbots. In addition to this I also wanted to create a framework that can be adopted by others to build their own user-centred chatbot personalities. This framework was implemented to answer whether personality matters to the user experience of conversational agents.
