\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

The results you have collected and the process you when through to develop the project have been presented earlier.  This Chapter is used to talk about your interpretations of results or the process.  It might be a discussion of the language you used.  A tool that you started to use but then stopped using for some reason.  It could give insight into the evolution of your process.

Future research:

Use the agree framework for actively when testing the personality. The framework is built on participants interacting with a chatbot in a series of interactions where there is a change in attitude (e.g. unfriendly, neutral, friendly). Instead of testing the change in attitude in this project, participants will instead be asked to rate on a Likert scale to what extent they perceived the specific traits.
